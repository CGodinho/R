# Data

## Introduction

**Data** are observations collected from the field notes, surveys, and experiments which describe phenomena.

**Statistics** is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data.
  
Statistics follow the general process of investigation:
1. Identify a question or problem.
2. Collect relevant data on the topic.
3. Analyze the data.
4. Form a conclusion.

**Summary statistic** is a value computed from the data.


## Data Matrix

Also known as **Dataframe**.

Follow the [tidy data](https://github.com/CGodinho/R/blob/master/02-Concepts/tidy_data.md) principle with:

* Each **row represents** an **observation** (or case);
* Each **column** represents a **variable**. It is recommended to explicitly describe the variable content in an adjacent summary description to data.


## Variables

When two variables show some connection with one another, they are called **associated** variables (or dependent variables).

If 2 variables are not associated, they are **independent**.
