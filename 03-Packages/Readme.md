## stringr

Used to simplify string handling.

Created by Wickham and initially introduced in [the R jornal, volume 2, number 2](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2010-2/RJournal_2010-2_Wickham.pdf).

[Documentation and cheat sheet](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/index.html).

With stringr, handling strings becomes more clear.
